    "The purpose of this data science project is to come up with a forecasting model for organizations such as the federal reserve or any private business that is interested in forecasting the inflation rate in the near future. The Federal Reserve’s dual mandate requires monetary policy to aim for both maximum employment and price stability. [As the RMSEs show](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2011-economic-trends/et-20110107-the-accuracy-of-cpi-inflation-forecasts.aspx), the accuracy of inflation forecasts has varied a lot over time. Inflation forecasts were not very accurate in the 1970s and 1980s. Accuracy improved in the 1990s and began to fall again in the 2000s. \n",

    "This model is aimed to utilize disaggregate information to improve the forecast accuracy for the aggregated inflation rate. The disaggregated information has been proposed by [many researchers](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp589.pdf) with a dynamic factor model to reduce the dimensionality. However, the findings are mixed. This project aims to identify a statistical model that can improve the dynamic factor model in accuracy.  \n",
